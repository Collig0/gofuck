## A Brainfuck interpreter, written in Go.

This project is intended to be a very bare-bones, as simple as possible brainfuck interpreter.
It does zero optimizing, and zero tricks to make it more "modern" such as keeping track of loops.
It is supposed to be a bare-bones turing machine by design. I may make a more advanced version in the future, though.
